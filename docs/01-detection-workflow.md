# Detection Workflow

1. Identify attacker technique or suspicious behavior
2. Confirm required telemetry is available
3. Simulate the behavior in the lab
4. Observe raw log events (ground truth)
5. Write Sigma detection
6. Validate detection against generated events
7. Document tuning and false positives
