# Detection Engineering Lab Overview

This project focuses on building and validating high-signal Sigma detections
using Linux telemetry generated in a controlled lab environment.

The goal is to demonstrate a repeatable detection engineering workflow:
telemetry → hypothesis → simulation → detection → validation → tuning.
